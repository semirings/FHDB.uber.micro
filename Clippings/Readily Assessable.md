- **Scheduling / Appointments** (CSV from practice mgmt): date/time, provider, location, visit type, status/no-show.
- **ADT / Census snapshots** (daily CSV or HL7→CSV): admits, discharges, transfers, bed/ward. Great for throughput and LOS.
- **Billing / Claims summaries** (CSV or data mart views): CPT/HCPCS, ICD, revenue codes, payer, charges/denials. High value for cost/utilization.
- **Staffing / Time & Attendance** (CSV): shift start/stop, skill mix, unit. Pairs well with census for productivity ratios.
- **Quality measure extracts / Registry files** (CSV/Excel): stroke/AMI/Sepsis bundle fields; typically scrubbed for submission → easy to reuse.
- **DICOM study lists (metadata only)** from PACS admin exports: StudyDate, Modality, Accession, MRN (can be hashed), StudyDesc. No images needed to start.

Why fast: These live outside the transactional EHR, have standard reporting, and IT is used to handing them to finance/ops—easy to repurpose for analytics.

# Tier 2 — EHR core, but with “light” integration

- **HL7 v2 feeds → landing CSV**: ADT, Orders/Results (ORU), Pharmacy (RDE/RDS). A one-time channel to your interface engine or file drop gets you rolling.
- **FHIR Bulk/Flat NDJSON (if enabled)**: Patients, Encounters, Observations (labs/vitals), Medications, Procedures. Export jobs on a schedule; great schema for D4M/AA (column = FHIR path).
- **CCD/CCDA batches** from HIE/EHR: periodic dumps; parse headers, sections, and narrative text for NLP.

Why medium: Needs an interface owner’s blessing and a scheduled drop, but not a deep app project.

# Tier 3 — Higher friction, still tractable with sponsorship

- **Free-text clinical notes** (de-identified or limited data set): huge analytics payoff (NLP, safety signals). Needs governance + de-id path.
- **Medication administrations (MAR) & orders** at event grain: supports safety and throughput studies; available but sometimes siloed.
- **Device/telemetry** (ICU monitors, vents, pumps) downsampled: vendors can export; align on timebases and IDs.

Why harder: PHI density, higher event rate, and cross-system ID reconciliation.

# Tier 4 — “Plan for later”

- **Live streaming** from interface engines, full images/video, full audit logs. Great but usually not first-month material.
