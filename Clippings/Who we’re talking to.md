**Primary buyer:** Product & platform leads at clinical software vendors (EHR add-ons, care management, population health, quality, rev-cycle).  
**What they want:** Faster data onboarding, safer access to PHI, credible PIT (point-in-time) joins, clean cohorts for analytics/AI—without owning a data warehouse rebuild.

# Positioning (vendor-facing)

**Name (external):** **D4M Access Gateway** *(codename: Hazoo)*  
**Tagline:** *Secure point-in-time cohorts for analytics & AI.*  
**One-liner:**  
“**D4M Access Gateway** turns clinical data—numbers and FHIR narrative—into **point-in-time, audited cohorts** your app can consume via API. Open source, cloud-ready, and built to embed.”

# Why a vendor should care (clear benefits)

- **Ship faster:** Drop-in gateway for **PIT joins, cohort assembly, and audit**—no need to build this undifferentiated plumbing.
- **Lower risk:** Proven access patterns, **append-only lineage**, and full **audit trails** help pass security reviews.
- **Performance at volume:** Designed for **high-cardinality, append-heavy** data (options, claims, encounters, notes).
- **AI-ready:** Produces **training/testing slices** with leakage controls; same pipeline powers product analytics.
- **Open source + commercial safety:** Use freely, fork if needed, sponsor to influence roadmap.

# What it is (feature bullets you can put on a site/README)

- **Secure Access Layer:** policy, authZ, **column visibility**, audit logs.
- **Point-in-Time Joins:** publish/effective-time aware; no leakage.
- **Cohort Engine:** DSL → plans → API; numeric + **FHIR.narrative** text in the same slice.
- **Outputs for everything:** JSON/Arrow for apps & ML; **AA/D4M** for sparse analytics; Tableau/Notebook friendly.
- **Scales out:** stateless microservices; runs on AWS (Graviton), k8s, or bare EC2.
- **No warehouse rebuilds:** append-first design; materialize only hot views.

# OSS stance (what vendors need to hear)

- **License:** **Apache-2.0** (permissive, vendor-friendly).
- **Contribution model:** **DCO** or **CLA**, documented `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Security policy:** private disclosure e-mail, CVE process, signed releases (SBOM + checksums).
- **Governance:** lightweight **maintainers council** + public roadmap/issues.

# Integration hooks (so PMs/architects can imagine fitting it in)

- **Ingress:** Kafka/S3/HDFS, FHIR endpoints, files (Parquet/CSV/JSONL).
- **Storage backends:** Hadoop/Accumulo + adapters; pluggable for ClickHouse/Delta later.
- **APIs:**
	- `POST /cohorts/query` → plan (PIT join + filters)
	- `GET /cohorts/{id}/data?fmt=arrow|json`
	- `POST /ml/slice` → training/test splits with embargo rules
	- `GET /audit/events?cohortId=…`
- **SDKs:** minimal client for **Python/Julia/Java**.

# Funding/sponsorship pitch (what “support” buys)

- **Bronze (5–10k/yr):** logo, quarterly roadmap call, vote on minor features.
- **Silver (25k/yr):** prioritized issues, security pre-alerts, integration office hours.
- **Gold (50–100k/yr):** feature co-design, private branch builds, performance clinics, co-marketing case study.
- **Founding sponsor:** seats on maintainers council + public “built with you” recognition.

# Messaging you can reuse (short copy blocks)

**Homepage hero:**  
*Turn clinical data into point-in-time cohorts—secure, audited, and ready for analytics & AI. Open-source gateway your product can ship with confidence.*

**First-mention in deck:**  
*The D4M Access Gateway (codename: Hazoo) is a secure, open-source access layer that assembles point-in-time cohorts from clinical data—structured numbers and FHIR narrative—so vendors can deliver analytics and AI features without building a warehouse team.*

**Email to prospective sponsors (pasteable):**

> Subject: Open-source point-in-time cohorts for your product
> 
> Hi <Name>,  
> We’re open-sourcing the **D4M Access Gateway**, a secure, audited layer that converts clinical data—numbers and FHIR narrative—into **point-in-time cohorts** for analytics and AI. It’s cloud-ready, vendor-friendly (Apache-2.0), and already powers AA/D4M pipelines for large volumes.
> 
> If you’re building analytics or AI features and want leak-free training/test data and faster customer onboarding, I’d love to show you a 15-minute demo and discuss sponsorship options that put your priorities on the roadmap.  
> — <You>

# “Proof in 10 minutes” demo flow (for vendor calls)

1. **Ingest:** show a small FHIR bundle + CSV vitals arriving.
2. **Query:** run a **PIT cohort** (date window + diagnosis + narrative contains keyword).
3. **Export:** download Arrow + JSON; open in a notebook and Tableau.
4. **AI slice:** call `/ml/slice` to get train/test with embargo.
5. **Audit:** show the log line that proves who pulled what/when.

# Name: final recommendation

Public brand: **D4M Access Gateway** (with “powered by Hazoo” for continuity).  
Keep “Hazoo” in code packages and internal docs; lead with the descriptive name in all vendor-facing materials.
