## ðŸŽ¯ How to position each piece under the main point

### 1\. D4M/Hazoo > OLAP/RDBMS

- Traditional OLAP = expensive, rigid cubes.
- D4M = associative arrays, flexible, mathematically elegant, scales horizontally.
- **Benefit:** Lower cost + broader applicability.

### 2\. Notebook access (Jupyter/Pluto)

- Analysts can directly experiment with queries and visualizations.
- **Benefit:** Faster iteration, no middleman BI engineer.

### 3\. Blender 3D

- Conventional dashboards hide clusters/outliers.
- Blender fly-throughs make patterns visible, compelling, and sharable.
- **Benefit:** Insights that persuade and inform.
