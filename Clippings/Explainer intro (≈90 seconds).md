**VO:**  
Every day, your work creates data—numbers in dashboards, notes in charts, and narratives in the record. You already explore that data in tools you know: spreadsheets, Jupyter or Pluto notebooks, or commercial dashboards like Tableau.

**VO:**  
But some of the most valuable signals hide in plain text—like **FHIR Narrative** and other clinical notes. HAZoo lets that text sit right beside your numbers, so you can search it, filter it, and line it up with everything else you track.

**VO:**  
Behind the scenes, D4M works as an **access engine**. Think of it as a fast switchboard: you ask a question—*patients with this code, in this window, with these notes*—and D4M assembles exactly the slice you need, without rebuilding cubes or re-indexing.

**VO:**  
To make ad-hoc collection and organization simple, we use **Associative Arrays**—AA for short. Picture a flexible grid where rows and columns are just meaningful labels—*patient | date | code | provider*. When new data shows up, we just **append** it. No migrations. No schema surgery.

**VO:**  
HAZoo is the secure, scalable gateway that connects it all. It enforces access, logs what was used and when, and scales out as your volume grows—so the same question that works for a pilot also works across a hospital system.

**VO:**  
And when you want to *see* the data: AA slices display anywhere. In a notebook for quick analysis. In Tableau for operational dashboards. Or—even better—inside **Blender** for rich, 3D fly-throughs that make patterns jump out.

**VO:**  
One more thing: D4M + HAZoo isn’t just for insight—it’s built to **prepare AI/ML training and testing data**. Clean cohorts, point-in-time joins, and labeled slices come straight from the same pipeline you use for analytics.

**VO (close):**  
Familiar tools up front. Powerful engines underneath. From narrative text to numbers to 3D—D4M, AA, and HAZoo turn what you already have into answers you can act on.
