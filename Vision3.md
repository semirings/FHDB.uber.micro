We are working with the idea of, "It is a thing."  If we say, "FHIR analytics is a thing."  we are potentially limiting ourselves to talking about structural FHIR.  But we also want to include FHIR.narrative, SS, CSV and other forms of ad-hoc data collection.  We want to show how these can be converted into AA and then into HAZoo.  Ultimately, we want to show how D4M can bring these together for analysis.  We want to make the case for: "What is your data hiding from you?"

D4M, HAZoo work together with AA as the binding agent.

ACRONYMS PARADE ACROSS THE SCREEN: FHIR, NARRATIVE, SPREADSHEET, CSV EXPORTS, APPOINTMENTS

FHIR structures yeah resources.  FHIR.narratives ok.  Spreadsheets all kinds of ad-hoc data.  exports, notes

Ever wonder what hides in all that data?


ACRONYMS ARE ALIGNED ACROSS. THEY BEND UPWARD INTO AN ARC.  EYES APPEAR IN THE ARCHWAY.
