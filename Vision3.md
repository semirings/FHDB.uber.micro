We are working with the idea of, "It is a thing."  If we say, "FHIR analytics is a thing."  we are potentially limiting ourselves to talking about structural FHIR.  But we also want to include FHIR.narrative, SS, CSV and other forms of ad-hoc data collection.  We want to show how these can be converted into AA and then into HAZoo.  Ultimately, we want to show how D4M can bring these together for analysis.  We want to make the case for: "What is your data hiding from you?"

D4M, HAZoo work together with AA as the binding agent.

Can we relate up different sources? Make connections? And what about all that ad-hoc business?

 FHIR structures yeah resources.  FHIR.narratives  Spreadsheets all kinds of ad-hoc data,  exports, notes

Ever wonder what hides in all that data?

What kinds of insights and understandings are lurking in there?

AA stands for associative array.  It is a data structure. Our definition is the one put forth my MIT.  It is a rigorous  definition that is mathematically sound.
AA is conceptually quite simple.  If you have seen a spread sheet, you have an idea of what an AA is. If you use a spread sheet to maintain data, you likely have an AA in the making.  Just follow a few rules, and you have something that can be readily stored in a database and queried with power. 

FHIR, when implemented according to the spec, dovetails nicely with AA.  A FHIR resource can be converted to and from an AA readily.  

AAs can be aggregated.  Small AAs can be added together into large AAs. AAs can be searched/queried.   They can be navigated.  All can be done with ease.  

Populate an AA with the narrative from a volume of FHIR resources, and search the volume.
