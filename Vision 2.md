## logline
An explainer video that illustrates the concepts of FHDB and brings forth the problems with current situation and how FHDB addresses them.

## synopsis
### Target audience
1. For **The Data-Curious Clinician / Researcher**
2. For the **Technical Health-IT Leader / Data Engineer**
3. For the **Academic / Policy Researcher**

We parade some key concepts across the screen.  AA D4M HAZoo OLAP SQL DataLake SS. We parade them in an order that puts the familiar concepts first. These are decorated text. The narration introduces each one.

Every day, work creates data—numbers in dashboards, notes in charts, and narratives in the record. You already explore that data in the tools you know: spreadsheets, Jupyter or Pluto notebooks, or commercial products like Tableau, et.al.

But some of the most valuable signals hide in plain text—like **FHIR Narrative**, other clinical notes and FHIR resources themselves. HAZoo lets that text sit right beside your numbers, so you can search it, filter it, and line it up with everything else you track.

### key concepts
- AA for ad-hoc data collection and organization. How it incorporates into HAZoo.
- FHIR.narrative and other text. How it incorporates into HAZoo.
- How D4M acts as an access engine.
- How an AA can be displayed with a notebook (Jupyter, Pluto, et.al.); a commercial product (Tableau); or Blender for a rich experience in 3d.
- How HAZoo scales and is secure.
- One more thing, D4M/HAZoo is good for Ai/ML training and testing data preparation.
