## 🎯 Likely Target Personas for Your D4M Explainer

### 1. **Data-Curious Clinician / Researcher**

- **Profile:** Works with healthcare data (clinical notes, safety events, outcomes).
    
- **Pain:** Can query basic stats in Excel/SQL, but struggles to _see patterns_ (clusters, outliers).
    
- **Need:** A way to turn raw datasets into _intuitive visuals_ without buying a commercial BI license.
    
- **Message to them:** “You can take the CSV you already export and explore it in 3D — no extra enterprise tooling.”

### 2. **Technical Health-IT Leader / Data Engineer**

- **Profile:** Manages pipelines (ETL, Hadoop/Spark, SQL stores). Curious about new paradigms but skeptical of hype.
    
- **Pain:** Legacy OLAP cubes and BI dashboards are costly, rigid, and don’t scale.
    
- **Need:** A demo that shows D4M is **open, lightweight, and mathematically rigorous**.
    
- **Message to them:** “Associative arrays provide the same query power as OLAP, but with simpler algebra — and you can visualize directly in Blender.”

### 3. **Academic / Policy Researcher**

- **Profile:** Writes grant proposals or publishes in healthcare analytics.
    
- **Pain:** Needs to communicate findings visually to mixed audiences.
    
- **Need:** An _explainable, reproducible pipeline_ from dataset → math → visualization.
    
- **Message to them:** “Our microservice + Blender pipeline produces compelling visuals you can drop into slides and papers.”
